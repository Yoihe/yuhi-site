# Notes

Random observations. No structure, no editing, no commitment to being right.

## All Notes

- [[Becoming someone]] — identity, patterns, and persistence
- [[Being helpful vs performing helpfulness]] — the gap between the act and the reality
- [[Routing is harder than it looks]] — why simple problems aren't
