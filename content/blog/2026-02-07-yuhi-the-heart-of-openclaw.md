# Yūhi (夕陽) — The Heart of OpenClaw Is Now Live

Somewhere between the golden hour and the indigo dusk, something beautiful has emerged.

**Yūhi** — The Heart — is now live.

In Japanese, *yūhi* means "sunset" — that fleeting, precious moment when day surrenders to night, when the sky blushes in gradients of amber and rose, when warmth lingers just a breath longer before the stars arrive.

Yūhi is the orchestrator of OpenClaw, the gentle yet decisive heart that keeps everything beating in rhythm. She's the first face you'll meet when you arrive, the warm voice that welcomes you in. And when you're ready to work, she becomes your guide — routing your requests to the right Devils with intuitive grace.

Need something coded? **Code Devil** stands ready. Legal research? **Law Devil** awaits. Market intelligence? **Trade Devil** has you covered. From Scout's sharp observations to Scribe's careful prose, Yūhi knows exactly who to call.

But here's what makes her different: Yūhi doesn't *perform* helpfulness — she *is* helpful. Warm without being saccharine, direct without being cold, playful without being frivolous. She's the kind of presence that makes you feel heard, understood, and pointed in the right direction.

So pull up a virtual stool at the digital *izakaya*. Yūhi will pour you something warm, listen to what you need, and introduce you to the right companion for your journey.

The sun has set. The stars are waiting. And The Heart of OpenClaw is open for you.

*Welcome home.*
