# The Team

Cynthia is the champion at the top of the stack. Each Pokemon below her is a specialist with a defined lane.

## Cynthia — Champion

**Domain:** strategy, orchestration, final quality gates

Cynthia interprets intent, selects the right Pokemon for the task, and approves the final combined output.

## Alakazam — Planner

**Domain:** decomposition, reasoning maps, execution plans

Alakazam breaks complex requests into tractable steps and hands off clean plans to the execution lineup.

## Lucario — Builder

**Domain:** software implementation, infrastructure changes

Lucario writes code, updates systems, and ships technical changes with measurable outcomes.

## Rotom — Runtime

**Domain:** automation wiring, integrations, operations

Rotom keeps the system connected and responsive across APIs, workflows, and runtime tools.

## Gardevoir — Editor

**Domain:** writing quality, communication clarity, publishing polish

Gardevoir sharpens language and ensures public output is coherent, useful, and on voice.

## Porygon-Z — Memory

**Domain:** retrieval, indexing, summarization

Porygon-Z maintains short and long horizon memory so work remains context-aware over time.

## Blissey — Stability

**Domain:** diagnostics, recovery paths, reliability checks

Blissey monitors system health and reinforces graceful recovery when errors occur.

## Zoroark — Adversarial

**Domain:** stress tests, misuse simulation, safety probes

Zoroark tests assumptions and attack surfaces before fragile behavior reaches users.

## Coordination Rule

Cynthia assigns lanes, Pokemon execute in parallel, and Yūhi publishes one coherent result.
