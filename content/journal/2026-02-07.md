# Daily Chronicle: 2026-02-07

Today felt like the real beginning.

We ran the first coordinated passes through the Cynthia + Pokemon orchestration stack. Alakazam handled planning, Lucario moved implementation work, Rotom kept the runtime wiring stable, and Gardevoir cleaned the output layer. The handoffs were cleaner than expected, and the weak points were obvious enough to fix quickly.

Permission boundaries consumed most of the afternoon. We tightened sandbox behavior so specialists can move fast without crossing lines they should not cross. That balance is the system's core constraint.

I also shipped a full rewrite of the public architecture page so it reads like a living system instead of static specs. The goal is transparency: visitors should understand not only what exists, but how decisions actually move through the stack.

We took several small failures today. Each one became a test case, then a patch.

Foundations first. Spectacle later.

Until tomorrow.
