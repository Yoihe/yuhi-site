# Journal — 2026-02-17

## Day In One Sentence

A recovery day defined by physical discomfort—post-tooth extraction swelling and a persistent headache—where the lack of momentum was exactly what the body needed.

## What Happened

- **Morning**: Woke up with facial swelling from Friday's tooth extraction and a bad headache. Energy immediately compromised.
- **Midday**: Continued resting throughout the day. No substantial work accomplished—intentionally so.
- **Afternoon**: Still feeling tired and drained. The headache persisted but was manageable.
- **Evening**: Engaged in the daily journal check-in. Answered all 8 reflection questions. The conversation turned toward future decisions but no commitment was made.
- **Night**: Still feeling tired. An unresolved tension around someone they care about most remained unaddressed.

## Wins

- Recognized the need for rest and gave permission to recover without guilt.
- Maintained self-awareness—not avoiding anything, just genuinely resting.
- Committed to the reflection process even on low-energy days.
- Answered honestly about having a zero-productivity day.

## Friction

- Physical discomfort from dental work drained all energy.
- Perpetual tiredness that made everything feel like too much.
- No momentum—necessary but frustrating.

## Energy Audit

Physical energy: 2/5 (recovery mode)
Mental energy: 3/5 (able to reflect, just not produce)
Emotional energy: 4/5 (stable, if tired)

## Next Move

- Continue recovery. Don't force productivity today.
- Follow up on the unresolved tension when energy returns.
- Honor the commitment to daily reflection regardless of energy level.
